title: "The never-ending quest for the perfect IDE"

I always wonder why some developers stick with the defaults of their IDE and how they can resist (if not be immune) to the urge to customize their editor and tailor the experience to their needs.

I spend so much time looking at code and manipulating it, I have to feel comfortable while doing it. My IDE becomes a sort of second virtual home: a visually appealing place with all the stuff I need within reach, where everything seems familiar and to my taste.

And like one would do with their own house, my IDE is constantly under construction. As much as I am aware that perfection is nothing but an illusion, I still venture into the golden quest for the perfect IDE, a never-ending one.

## The software

Long gone are the university days, using EMACS to write some already oudated code. Whenever I joined my first company, working with C# forced me to use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). I hated it. It was slow, ugly and a total resource hog. 

Playing around Unity (and having more freedom away from professional projects), I tried [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), JetBrains' C# IDE. It was refreshing. Interface was cleaner and simpler, defaults were satisfying and it came with Resharper (some powerful C# linting/refactoring tool) enabled and optimized by default.

It was only a couple years later when I started woring with JavaScript that I was introduced to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or VSCode for short. Compiling, linting or running a dev server was done through terminal commands, the IDE was no longer an essential brick of the build process: it was a tool to help me navigate through the code.

On its own, VSCode is pretty empty: it is a platform, and with it come **extensions**. Over 75000 plugins you can install: language supports, refactoring tools, CLIs integrations, themes... No matter what you are looking for, there is an extesion for it. Or is there? We will talk about that later.

VSCode was satisfying to me. It is reasonably fast (compared to full blown IDEs), easy to install on all sorts of machines, and extendable enough to make it really comfortable, to make it my own. I had no reason to change for something else. Until AI happened. 

For those unaware, [I firmly reject AI](@/on-resisting-ai.md). And having it shoved down my throat the way VSCode did left my a very bitter taste of the IDE I enjoyed so much.

## Pluggable IDEs: a world of extensions

I talked about extending VSCode earlier, let's dive in the jungle of extensions that it offers, and the cost that comes with it.

Working with Vue a lot, I installed the Vue language support extension and some integrations of commonly used CLIs like ESLint and Prettier. And a theme. I fell in love with Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl). I really liked it, the choice of colors for the languages I was using really helped with reading code faster.
