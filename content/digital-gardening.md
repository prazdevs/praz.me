I grew up with the internet. From the Windows95 family computer to my smartphone, it has always accompanied me. According to [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), the internet is "the worldâ€™s largest global communication network for computers and other devices". Within the internet is a service called the World Wide Web. From now on I will refer to it as **The Web**.

> The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages.

That's the definition of the web according to [The Free Encyclopedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). I'm using Wikipedia for a reason: it is the website I remember the most when I think of what the web was back then. But what do I really remember of "the old web"?

## The web of my childhood

Static pages. Text. Hyperlinks. Low quality images... Somtimes they made sense, and sometimes it was an absolute mess. Poor design and questionnable "user experience", yet it didn't matter.

I learnt how to make efficient inputs in search engines to be presented web pages with content I would be looking for. Followed by a game of jumping from page to page, clicking links and exploring content --- most of the time it was video game tips or cheat codes I was looking for.

Some websites I was visiting more often than others. Eventually, I got used to ugly designs because they were simple. Ugly? maybe... Simple? without a doubt. The web was "digestible" by then.

With the amount of time I was spending on the family computer and my known curiosity, my dad helped me create my very own web page using [Microsoft Frontpage](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage), a WYSIWIG editor.

Oh, was that website ugly. It had some screaming background colors, with buttons and links of all shapes and colors, a visitor counter, weirdly styled big texts (named WordArt) and poorly cropped low quality images... And I talked about my life, my friends or the music I enjoyed at the time.

Oh, was that website ugly, and even pointless to most. But it was mine: I made it with all my heart, creativity and stories, using the tools I was introduced to. And I had pride in being the only kid in the class to have my own webpage that anyone could read at home.
